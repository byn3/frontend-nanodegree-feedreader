# Project Overview

![A site that collects multiple feeds, publications and news updates for specific sites](https://github.com/byn3/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/blob/master/FeedCollector.png
)

In this project I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
Jamine is used to test the site. The test suite is well rounded and covers many exceptions and issues.



## How to run this app

Git clone this repo, open the index.html file, and viol√†.
The app runs the tests and then the Feed reader loads the feeds and shows them on the window/ browser.

The tests covered in the jasmine/spc/feedreader.js file are defined URLs, names, values, a CSS attribute, and the functionality of the loaded feeds.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
